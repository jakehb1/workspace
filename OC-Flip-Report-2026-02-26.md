### 🥈 #2 — 10271 Garrett Rd, Stanton 90680
**List: $798,000 · 3bd/2ba · 1,203 sqft · 2 days on market**

| Rehab (light-medium) | $75,000 |
| Carrying (3% ARV) | $30,450 |

**List: $874,888 · 3bd/2ba · 958 sqft · 22 days on market**

---

### #4 — 9682 Hillview Rd, Anaheim 92804
**List: $988,000 · 4bd/2ba · 1,472 sqft · 5 days on market**

Anaheim 92804 is solid mid-market flip territory. 4/2 at 1,472 sqft gives good bones for a kitchen/bath refresh. Comps for renovated 4/2 in this zip: $1.2M–$1.3M.

|------|--------|
| Purchase | $988,000 |
| Rehab (light) | $60,000 |

---

### #5 — 1822 W 4th St, Santa Ana 92703
**List: $449,900 · 2bd/1ba · 767 sqft · 27 days on market**

Lowest entry price on the list. Santa Ana 92703 is distressed territory with a wide spread between fixer and renovated. 767 sqft limits ARV but the buy-in is very low. Great for a smaller budget or a quick light flip.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase (negotiated) | $420,000 |
| Rehab (light) | $45,000 |
| Carrying (3% ARV) | $21,750 |
| Selling (6% ARV) | $43,500 |
| **ARV** | **$725,000** |
| **Est. Net Profit** | **$194,750** |

**Margin: ~37% — highest margin on the list if the ARV holds. Santa Ana 92703 median is ~$800K for renovated SFH; conservative at $725K for small sqft.**

---

### #6 — 1533 S Greenville St, Santa Ana 92704
**List: $650,000 · 2bd/1ba · 980 sqft · 46 days on market**

46 days on market — most negotiable listing in the batch. 92704 median renovated SFH ~$960K. Low sqft hurts but the days on market create leverage.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Purchase (negotiated) | $610,000 |
| Rehab (medium) | $80,000 |
| Carrying (3% ARV) | $27,900 |
| Selling (6% ARV) | $55,800 |
| **ARV** | **$930,000** |
| **Est. Net Profit** | **$156,200** |

**Margin: ~24% · 46 DOM = most negotiating room on the list**

## Filtered Out (Thin or No Margin)

| Address | Why Cut |
|---------|---------|
| 0 Hot Springs Canyon Rd, SJC | Mobile home park — no ARV comp support for flips |
| 6262/6272 Chinook Ave, Westminster | Duplicate listings, 1,038 sqft, $880K already near ARV |
| 3268 Michigan Ave, Costa Mesa | Listed today at $1.195M — near ARV for Costa Mesa, no margin |
| 23915 Sprig St, Mission Viejo | $950K, 1,316 sqft — Mission Viejo ARV tight, soft flip zip |
| 9220 Whitney Way, Cypress | $1.2M, 2,710 sqft — at max budget, Cypress ARV ~$1.3M, margin too thin |
| 8032 Lancashire Cir, La Palma | $1.085M, already large/nice home — fixer label but near ARV |
| 1439 W Kiama Pl, Anaheim | 6bd at $1.1M — likely ADU-focused, not clean flip profile |

## Notes
- ARVs are estimates based on Zillow city/zip medians — verify with a local agent and pulled comps before making offers
- Santa Ana (92703/92704) has the widest spreads but the roughest neighborhoods — verify street-level comps
- Westminster 92683 is the hottest zip in OC right now — move fast if pursuing Chinook/Locust
- Days on market >20 = negotiating room. Target 5–8% under asking minimum
- All figures pre-tax. Factor state capital gains if holding <1 year
