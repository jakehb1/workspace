### 🥇 #1 — 210 S Raitt St, Santa Ana 92703
**MLS: OC26041198 · $769,000 · 5bd/2ba · 2,200 sqft**  
[Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/210-S-Raitt-St_Santa-Ana_CA_92703_M13174-28094)

**⚠️ Important note:** Listing describes this as a **duplex** with an unpermitted garage conversion. Not a standard SFH flip — more complex. Permits required. Verify zoning before proceeding.

**Listing description:**
> "Rare chance to acquire a duplex with significant upside potential in a high-demand rental market. Ideal for investors, flippers, or BRRRR strategy buyers. Property includes new roof and newly installed solar panels (paid off). Two units, plus garage converted to living space (not permitted — buyer to verify and assume responsibility)."

| **Office** | Bonsall, CA |

**Comp Data (92703 — Redfin Jan 2026):**
- Zip median SFH: **$800,000** (-5.3% YoY — declining market, use conservative ARV)
- Renovated duplex premium: +20–30% over SFH median
- At 2,200 sqft renovated duplex in 92703: realistic ARV **$950K–$1.05M** (conservative given -5.3% trend)

**Revised Flip Math:**
| Item | Conservative | Optimistic |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Purchase (negotiated) | $720,000 | $740,000 |
| Rehab (permit unpermitted space + full reno) | $160,000 | $120,000 |
| Carrying 3% | $28,500 | $31,500 |
| Selling 6% | $57,000 | $63,000 |
| **ARV** | **$950,000** | **$1,050,000** |
| **Est. Net Profit** | **~$−15,500** | **~$95,500** |

**Verdict:** Riskier than it looked. The unpermitted conversion and declining zip trend tighten margins significantly. Works only if you negotiate hard (<$720K), keep rehab lean, and hit the optimistic ARV. Not the slam dunk it appeared.

**Comp Data (92706 — Santa Ana South, Redfin Jan 2026):**
- Zip median SFH: **$800,000** (-5.0% YoY — use conservative ARV)
- Renovated 3/2 at 1,264 sqft: comps $900K–$980K

## Key Changes From Previous Report

1. **#1 flipped to #2 Anaheim** — 210 S Raitt is a duplex with unpermitted work in a declining zip. The Anaheim 92805 deal (Gary Masciel) is now the cleanest high-margin SFH flip.
2. **Fullerton moves up** — estate sale dynamic + park views + premium zip = real upside. Call Samantha Turgeon.
3. **Santa Ana 92706 removed from top picks** — zip down 5% YoY. At asking price, margin is nearly zero. Only viable below $700K.
4. **Euclid/Anaheim 92802 stays marginal** — HOA community + small sqft. Below threshold.

## Immediate Next Steps

**Call today:**
1. **Gary Masciel** (714) 612-8999 — 1316 N East St, Anaheim. Ask: "Any offers? What's the seller's situation?" Listed since early Feb — motivated.
2. **Samantha Turgeon** (909) 437-4350 — 2313 Lark Ellen Dr, Fullerton. Estate sale. Ask about seller timeline and flexibility on price.

**Due diligence before offer on Raitt St:**
- Verify duplex zoning status
- Get permit history (unpermitted garage conversion)
