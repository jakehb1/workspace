# OC Flip Opportunities — 2026-02-26

> **Research Method & Limitations:** This report is based on verified market data pulled from the California Association of Realtors (CAR) and Redfin's per-zip housing market pages (Jan 2026). Real-time distressed listing scraping was blocked by all major portals (Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin search, Trulia) during this session — they require JavaScript or authenticated browser sessions. HAR.com covers Houston (TX only); MLSListings.com covers the Bay Area only, not CRMLS/OC. Live listing access requires the browser tool or PropStream/BatchLeads with a login. **All deal scenarios below are modeled on real verified zip-level medians** — they represent the type of deal you should be targeting, not pulled addresses.

## Part 1: Orange County Market Context (Jan 2026)

### County-Level Overview (Source: California Association of Realtors)
| Metric | Value | YoY Change |
|---|---|---|
| Median SFH Sale Price (OC) | **$1,410,000** | -1.4% |
| Sales Volume (Jan 2026 vs Dec 2025) | — | -24.8% MoM |
| Market Direction | Softening at top | — |

**Key implication:** The OC-wide median is $1.41M, but working-class cities (Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Stanton) trade at $765K–$900K. The spread between distressed and renovated in these markets is the flip opportunity — estimated $200K–$350K gross spread before costs.

## Part 2: Best Flip Zip Codes — Ranked by Opportunity (Jan 2026 Redfin Data)

| Zip | City | Median Price | YoY | DOM | Sale/List | Compete Score | Flip Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **90680** | Stanton | $765K | +7.7% | 45 | 100.2% | 81 — Very Competitive | 🔥 Best entry price + strong appreciation |
| **92703** | Santa Ana (W) | $800K | -5.3% | **64** | 96.6% | 51 — Moderate | 🔥 Most distress, longest DOM = best negotiating leverage |
| **92704** | Santa Ana (S) | $800K | -5.0% | 36 | 98.7% | 84 — Very Competitive | ✅ Deep inventory, fast exit once renovated |
| **92843** | Garden Grove (S) | $868.5K | +8.6% | 41 | **102.4%** | 86 — Very Competitive | ✅ Homes selling ABOVE list — strong buyer demand post-reno |
| **92805** | Anaheim (E) | $880K | +4.1% | 59 | 98.8% | 72 — Very Competitive | ✅ Solid appreciation, moderate DOM |
| **92801** | Anaheim (W) | $850K | +2.8% | 56 | 99.2% | 79 — Very Competitive | ✅ Multiple offers, good exit velocity |
| **92832** | Fullerton (W) | $900K | 0.0% | 45 | 98.9% | 73 — Very Competitive | ⚠️ Flat appreciation, but higher ARV ceiling |
| **92683** | Westminster | $1.12M | +11.7% | 31 | 100.1% | 86 — Very Competitive | ⚠️ Too expensive for <$1.2M buy-in; better as ARV target |

### Key Takeaways
- **92703 (Santa Ana W)** is the distress epicenter: -5.3% YoY, 64 DOM, selling 3.4% below list. This is where estate sales, probates, and as-is listings concentrate.
- **92843 (Garden Grove S)** is the best post-renovation exit: 8.6% YoY appreciation + homes selling 2.4% above list. Buy in 92703/90680, renovate to 92843 quality.
- **Westminster (92683)** at $1.12M median shows where the renovated comps ceiling can go in this part of OC — a fully renovated home in adjacent zip codes can target $1.1M+ ARV.
- **30-35% price gap** exists between distressed (buy at $650–$800K) and renovated ($950K–$1.15M) in these markets. That's the gross spread.

## Part 3: Top Flip Scenarios — Modeled on Verified Market Data

> All scenarios use: Carrying costs = 3% of ARV; Selling costs = 6% of ARV; 6-month hold.

---

### 🥇 Deal #1 — Santa Ana 92703 | Heavy Rehab Estate Sale
**Target Profile:** 3/2, ~1,300–1,500 sqft, original condition, 1960s–70s build, estate or probate sale
- **Target Buy Price:** $640,000 (20% below 92703 median, achievable given -5.3% YoY trend + 64 DOM)
- **Rehab:** Heavy — full kitchen, both baths, flooring, HVAC, roof, paint, landscaping
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $140,000–$160,000
- **ARV:** $960,000–$1,000,000 (renovated 3/2 in S. OC at ~$640–680/sqft, consistent with 92704 at $606/sqft renovated)
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $980K ARV, $150K rehab):**
  - ARV: $980,000
  - Purchase: -$640,000
  - Rehab: -$150,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$29,400
  - Selling (6%): -$58,800
  - **Net Profit: $101,800 (10.4% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** 92703 has the most distressed inventory and most negotiating leverage in OC. Estate/probate sales are common in this older neighborhood stock (1950s–70s SFRs). Long DOM means less competition on acquisition. Renovated product exits into 92704's competitive buyer pool.
- **Risk:** Worst-case rehab on older OC homes can run long. Budget contingency of 15%.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92703` → Filter: House, Max $799K, keyword "as-is" or "estate" or "probate"

### 🥈 Deal #2 — Stanton 90680 | Medium Rehab Dated Home
**Target Profile:** 3/2, ~1,200–1,400 sqft, cosmetic to moderate distress
- **Target Buy Price:** $680,000 (~11% below 90680 median, achievable as median was $765K and 7.7% growth means it was ~$710K a year ago — ask is negotiable)
- **Rehab:** Medium — kitchen refresh, bath update, flooring, paint, curb appeal
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $85,000–$105,000
- **ARV:** $920,000–$960,000 (renovated homes in Stanton trade up toward Westminster/Garden Grove comps at $600–640/sqft)
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $940K ARV, $95K rehab):**
  - ARV: $940,000
  - Purchase: -$680,000
  - Rehab: -$95,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$28,200
  - Selling (6%): -$56,400
  - **Net Profit: $80,400 (8.5% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** Stanton is one of the cheapest entry points in OC with positive appreciation (+7.7%). Strong school ratings (Hansen ES 9/10, Patton ES 9/10) = motivated buyer pool on exit. 100.2% sale-to-list means renovated homes command full price.
- **Risk:** Stanton lacks the brand cachet of nearby Huntington Beach/Westminster. Renovated comps thin.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/90680` → Filter: House, Max $799K, keywords "fixer" or "as-is"

### 🥉 Deal #3 — Garden Grove 92843 | Light/Medium Rehab
**Target Profile:** 3/2, 1,300 sqft, dated but livable, cosmetic work needed
- **Target Buy Price:** $760,000 (12.5% below 92843 median; feasible on dated but livable stock)
- **Rehab:** Light-Medium — cosmetic kitchen, flooring, paint, bath fixtures, landscaping
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $60,000–$80,000
- **ARV:** $990,000–$1,050,000 (92843 median is $868.5K, but renovated premium = 15-20%; comparable to Westminster's $1.12M median trajectory)
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $1,020K ARV, $70K rehab):**
  - ARV: $1,020,000
  - Purchase: -$760,000
  - Rehab: -$70,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$30,600
  - Selling (6%): -$61,200
  - **Net Profit: $98,200 (9.6% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** 92843 is the hottest sub-market in this price tier — 8.6% appreciation + 102.4% sale-to-list (buyers bidding above ask). Great schools (9/10 on multiple elementaries). Fast 41-day DOM means quick exit.
- **Risk:** Entry competition is stiff — 86/100 compete score. Hard to buy at a discount without off-market or probate.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92843` → Filter: House, Max $850K, keywords "estate" or "as-is" or "fixer"

### 🏅 Deal #4 — Anaheim East 92805 | Medium Rehab Older Ranch
**Target Profile:** 3/2, 1,200–1,500 sqft, 1960s ranch-style, deferred maintenance
- **Target Buy Price:** $740,000 (~16% below 92805 median, achievable on as-is estate)
- **Rehab:** Medium — full cosmetic, HVAC, possible roof
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $100,000–$120,000
- **ARV:** $1,000,000–$1,050,000
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $1,025K ARV, $110K rehab):**
  - ARV: $1,025,000
  - Purchase: -$740,000
  - Rehab: -$110,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$30,750
  - Selling (6%): -$61,500
  - **Net Profit: $82,750 (8.1% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** Anaheim East (92805) sits near Disney/stadium employment corridors; strong buyer demand from working families priced out of Anaheim Hills. 4.1% YoY appreciation with 59 DOM = still some negotiating room.
- **Risk:** Longer DOM (59 days) on renovated product vs. Garden Grove.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92805` → Filter: House, Max $850K, keywords "fixer" or "TLC" or "handyman"

### 🏅 Deal #5 — Anaheim West 92801 | Light Rehab Dated Ranch
**Target Profile:** 3/2, 1,200–1,400 sqft, cosmetic distress, original cabinets/flooring
- **Target Buy Price:** $720,000 (~15% below 92801 median)
- **Rehab:** Light — cosmetic only (flooring, kitchen paint, counters, bath fixtures, landscaping)
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $45,000–$65,000
- **ARV:** $950,000–$1,000,000
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $975K ARV, $55K rehab):**
  - ARV: $975,000
  - Purchase: -$720,000
  - Rehab: -$55,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$29,250
  - Selling (6%): -$58,500
  - **Net Profit: $112,250 (11.5% of ARV)** ← Best light-rehab scenario
- **Why it works:** 92801 gets 4 offers on average; 79/100 compete score means renovated product exits quickly. Low rehab cost maximizes margin. Anaheim is an institutional-buyer magnet, so exit comp comps are well-supported.
- **Risk:** Finding a light-rehab opportunity under $720K in a 79-compete-score market is hard. Requires off-market or early detection.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92801` → Filter: House, Max $800K

### 🏅 Deal #6 — Fullerton 92832 | Medium Rehab Historic Core
**Target Profile:** 3/2, 1,300–1,600 sqft, near Historic Downtown Fullerton, original 1940s–60s condition
- **Target Buy Price:** $770,000 (~14% below 92832 median)
- **Rehab:** Medium (preserve historic character + kitchen/baths/systems)
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $100,000–$130,000
- **ARV:** $1,050,000–$1,150,000 (Downtown Fullerton premium; walkable, trendy neighborhood)
- **Gross Margin Calculation (using $1,100K ARV, $115K rehab):**
  - ARV: $1,100,000
  - Purchase: -$770,000
  - Rehab: -$115,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$33,000
  - Selling (6%): -$66,000
  - **Net Profit: $116,000 (10.5% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** 92832 has the highest ARV ceiling in this group ($900K median + renovated premium pushes to $1.1M+). Downtown Fullerton buyer pool skews toward young professionals who value walkability. 48.5-day DOM means reasonable exit speed.
- **Risk:** Older stock may have deferred structural issues (foundation, sewer). Budget contingency 20%.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92832` → Filter: House, Max $900K

### 🏅 Deal #7 — Santa Ana 92704 | Volume Play, Cosmetic Flip
**Target Profile:** 3/2, 1,200–1,400 sqft, cosmetic fixer in south Santa Ana near Fountain Valley border
- **Target Buy Price:** $700,000 (~12.5% below 92704 median)
- **Rehab:** Light — flooring, paint, kitchen facelift, bath fixtures, exterior
- **Estimated Rehab Cost:** $50,000–$70,000
- **ARV:** $930,000–$980,000 (92704 is highly competitive — 84/100, 8 offers avg — renovated product commands strong premiums)

  - Purchase: -$700,000
  - Rehab: -$60,000
  - Carrying (3%): -$28,650

  - **Net Profit: $109,050 (11.4% of ARV)**
- **Why it works:** 92704's extreme competition on renovated product (8 offers average, 36 DOM) means your exit risk is minimal. Buy cheap in the distress pocket, sell fast in the competitive buyer pool.
- **Risk:** Finding discounted inventory here is harder because the market is already competitive at all price points.
- **Find live listings:** `https://www.redfin.com/zipcode/92704` → Filter: House, Max $800K, keyword "as-is" or "fixer" or "estate sale"

## Part 5: Market Trends Affecting OC Flips (Feb 2026)

### Rate Environment
- 30-year fixed still hovering 6.5–7.0% range. Not ideal for buyer pool, but OC's high-cash buyer concentration (~25–30% cash sales historically) means flip exits are still viable. Buyers who can pay cash or 20%+ down are less rate-sensitive.

### Buyer Demand
- OC-wide sales volume down 24.8% MoM (Jan 2026, CAR) — partly seasonal (Jan is always slow). The zip-level data tells a different story: Garden Grove 92843 at 102.4% sale-to-list and Westminster 92683 at 100.1% with 31 DOM suggest pent-up demand in mid-tier price ranges.
- Renovated, turnkey SFRs under $1.1M remain scarce. This is your product. The buyer segment (move-up buyers, growing families) is rate-resistant enough to transact.

### Distressed Inventory
- CA foreclosure filings remain below 2019 levels but pre-foreclosure activity is ticking up statewide. OC estate/probate inventory is the most reliable distressed source — aging demographic in cities like Fullerton (92832), Santa Ana, and Anaheim means consistent turnover.
- Probate inventory in OC: Best accessed via court-filed probate petitions (Orange County Superior Court, Probate Division), not MLS. Many probate properties are sold off-market or through real estate attorneys.

### Permit Timelines
- City of Anaheim: 4–8 weeks for kitchen/bath permits; major additions 4–6 months.
- City of Santa Ana: 6–10 weeks for standard renos; historically slower than Anaheim.
- Garden Grove: 4–6 weeks for cosmetic permits.
- **Implication:** Light-to-medium rehabs (cosmetic + permitted mechanical) should target 3–4 month hold. Budget 6 months for heavy rehabs in Santa Ana.

### Market Softening (OC High End)
- OC median SFH declined 1.4% YoY — but this is skewed by the luxury end (Newport Beach, Laguna Beach). The $800K–$1.1M mid-market segment is *still appreciating* (+7.7% in Stanton, +8.6% in Garden Grove, +11.7% in Westminster). This is precisely the flip exit price range. Trend is your friend.

## Summary & Action Priorities

1. **Highest-margin light rehab:** 92801 (Anaheim W) or 92704 (Santa Ana S) — fast exits, competitive buyer pools
2. **Best value entry:** 90680 (Stanton) + 92703 (Santa Ana W) — lowest prices, highest discount negotiation room
3. **Best post-reno exit market:** 92843 (Garden Grove S) — selling 2.4% above list, fastest appreciation
4. **Best ARV ceiling:** 92832 (Fullerton W) — Downtown Fullerton premium pushes renovated product to $1.1M+
5. **Off-market is the key:** OC's competitive market means on-MLS distressed deals get multiple offers within days. Probate petitions, pre-foreclosure lists (PropStream), and direct mail to absentee/equity-rich owners in these zips are the real alpha.
