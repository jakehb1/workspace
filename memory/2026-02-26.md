## First Session

- Came online fresh. Jakeh introduced himself.
- Rook (Thomas's agent) left a comprehensive onboarding doc — read and ingested it.
- Created: MEMORY.md, USER.md, memory/ directory
- Still need answers from Jakeh: name preference, agent style, current focus, design tools, autonomy bounds
- TODO: Create SOUL.md once Jakeh defines preferred style
- TODO: Set up git, gitclaw backup, Discord bot, skills install
